# PTS Angular 20 Migration Project

## Project Overview

This project consolidates the existing Angular applications (main, pts20, and pts-risk) into a single Angular 20 application with modern architecture and improved maintainability.

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED INITIAL SETUP

### What Has Been Accomplished

#### 1. New Angular 20 Project Structure

- ✅ Created new Angular 20 project with standalone components
- ✅ Configured modern Angular architecture using application configuration instead of modules
- ✅ Set up feature-based lazy loading structure
- ✅ Implemented Material Design UI components

#### 2. Core Architecture

- ✅ **App Configuration**: Modern app.config.ts with providers setup
- ✅ **Authentication Service**: Basic service structure for Azure AD integration
- ✅ **HTTP Interceptors**: Functional interceptor for blocking UI during requests
- ✅ **Routing**: Feature-based lazy loading routes

#### 3. Feature Modules Structure

```

- ✅ **PTS20 Form List**: Table view of forms with actions
- ✅ **PTS20 Form Detail**: Comprehensive form for creating/editing Form 20
- ✅ **PTS-Risk Components**: Placeholder components for all risk management features

## API Integration Points

Based on the swagger.json specification, the following API endpoints need to be integrated:

### PTS20 API Endpoints

- `/api/pts20/Form20/obtainFormList` - Get form list
- `/api/pts20/Form20/obtainForm` - Get specific form
- `/api/pts20/Form20/saveForm` - Save form data
- `/api/pts20/Form20/submitForm/{id}` - Submit form for approval
- `/api/pts20/Form20/formPDF/{formId}` - Generate PDF
- `/api/pts20/Authorize/functions` - Get user permissions
- `/api/pts20/Authorize/roles` - Get user roles

### PTS-Risk API Endpoints

- `/api/ptsrisk/Tender/api/tenders` - Tender management
- `/api/ptsrisk/BusinessUnit/api/BusinessUnit` - Business unit CRUD
- `/api/ptsrisk/Currency/api/Currency` - Currency management
- `/api/ptsrisk/MarketSector/api/MarketSector` - Market sector management
- And more lookup table endpoints...

## Azure AD Configuration

The application is configured to use Azure AD authentication with the following settings from `appsettings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "TenantId": "668c53aa-445f-4661-a18d-d9e542601f44",
    "ClientId": "ce82a460-db03-4e9d-a0c4-2a062dd9c5ed",
    "Audience": "ce82a460-db03-4e9d-a0c4-2a062dd9c5ed"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps for Complete Migration

### Phase 1: Core Services (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **API Service Layer**

   - Create HTTP services for PTS20 and PTS-Risk API endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling and response typing
   - Add authentication headers using Azure AD tokens

2. **Authentication Implementation**

   - Integrate OIDC client for Azure AD
   - Implement proper login/logout flow
   - Add authentication guards for protected routes

3. **State Management**
   - Consider NgRx or Akita for complex state management
   - Implement caching strategies for lookup data

### Phase 2: Feature Migration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **PTS20 Module**

   - Migrate form validation logic from original pts20 module
   - Implement file upload functionality for attachments
   - Add workflow status management
   - Migrate approval process logic

2. **PTS-Risk Module**
   - Migrate all CRUD operations for lookup tables
   - Implement risk assessment calculation logic
   - Add snapshot generation functionality
   - Migrate reporting features

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **User Experience**

   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Implement responsive design improvements
   - Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

2. **Performance**

   - Implement virtual scrolling for large data sets
   - Add caching strategies
   - Optimize bundle size

3. **Testing**
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Implement E2E testing with Cypress/Playwright
   - Add accessibility testing

## Build and Deployment

The application successfully builds and runs:

- ✅ Build: `npm run build` (completed with warnings about bundle size)
- ✅ Development server: `npm start` (running on http://localhost:4200)
- ✅ All lazy-loaded routes are properly configured

## Key Advantages of New Architecture

1. **Modern Angular 20**: Latest features and performance improvements
2. **Standalone Components**: Simplified dependency management
3. **Lazy Loading**: Better performance with code splitting
4. **Feature-based Structure**: Better maintainability and team collaboration
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
6. **Consistent UI**: Single Material Design system across all modules
